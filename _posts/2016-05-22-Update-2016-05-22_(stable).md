title: Manjaro Update 2016-05-22 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our first update for Manjaro 16.06-rc1 (Daniella)!

With our first release candidate of Pamac v4.1 we are almost ready to present you the latest graphical packagemanager of Manjaro. We updated our UI to your needs and fixed found bugs you have reported to us. Followed new features you get by installing **pamac-dev**:

* reenabled double click to view details
* integrated progressbar and terminal view

Also all our kernels got updated to their latest point-releases. 3.13 kernel series is now depreciated. Please update to a more current one as we won't maintain any extramodules for this series. ZFS is now at 0.6.57 and thunderbird got updated to 45.1. Last but not least Deepin got refreshed and has now new features. Archlinux upstream fixes are now from: Fri May 20 20:37:55 CEST 2016.

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our stable branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/). A detailed list of package changes can been found [here](https://gist.githubusercontent.com/philmmanjaro/68c731b48492a25468b16bf3b96672c2/raw/29071649b43df281243b87db4c22ed11aadffdeb/stable-2016-05-22.txt).

Kind regards,
Philip MÃ¼ller and the Manjaro Development Team
