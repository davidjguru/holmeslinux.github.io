The Manjaro community is proud to present a long awaited installation media of our Enlightenment Edition.

This release keeps to the style of the 15.11 release being that it is highly vanilla, but of course is up-to-date at the time of build and includes the latest Manjaro back-end infrastructure. Note, this means a very vanilla E19 configuration with minimal app set provided out-of-the-box so you can style Enlightenment on your own.

This release is produced based on the [1st of November stable branch update](https://manjaro.github.io/Update-2015-11-01_(stable)/), a few highlights:

* Enlightenment 0.19.10
* Linux kernel 4.1.12 LTS
* systemd 227
* Xorg-server 1.17.4+fixes
* Mesa 11.0.4
* Firefox 41.0.2

Further updates for some of these components are already available in our respositories.
