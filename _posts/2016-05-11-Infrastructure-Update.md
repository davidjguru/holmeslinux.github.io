title: Manjaro is updating its infrastructure
---

Hello!

Manjaro goes Cloud. With our new friends at [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/) we are currently reconstructing our infrastructure for Manjaro Linux. We will ship soon a new fresh forum, updated wiki and other nice features to go along with our upcoming 16.06 distribution release. The new SSL certificates will be soon available thx to [Let'sEncrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/).

So stay tuned for more news to come ...

Kind regards,
The Manjaro Development Team
