The Manjaro community is proud to announce a new stable release of the **Deepin Edition**.

While the exciting modern China based project **Deepin** is still young and not yet completely bugfree, it has certainly evolved quite impressively during the last few months and become a reliable desktop environment to be used on an every day basis. For the Manjaro release many packages have been adjusted and customized in close cooperation with Arch-Deepin and Linuxdeepin to make the desktop experience as smooth and responsive as is expected from an Arch-based environment. **Manjaro Deepin 16.03** runs the latest state of development of the Deepin project, adding our well tried and tested in-house tools like **Manjaro Settings Manager** and of course package management with **Pamac** and **Pacman** for the best possible rolling release experience.

For more experienced users an alternative **minimal-edition** with only the basic environment pre-installed is also available for download.

**highlights**:  

* Kernel Linux 4.1
* Deepin 15.1
* Nautilus 3.18.5 with Sushi file preview
* Chromium 48
* Evolution 3.18.5.1
* Libre Office Suite 5.1
* Gimp 2.8.16
