The Manjaro community is proud to announce the release of **Manjaro i3 15.11**.

This edition features **i3-wm 4.11** of the **next-branch** including **sticky windows** and **i3-gaps**. We are honoured by an extremely helpful dialog with i3-developer Airblader on the implementation of the new functions.

Manjaro i3 is now fully maintained by packages and aims to be pre-configured for all basic needs while remaining completely customizable.
**Dmenu-manjaro 4.5.1** offers recency-awareness and mouse-interaction and has a designated config-file for appearance and terminal preferences.
**Urxvt-daemon** provides maximum terminal performance, **i3status-manjaro** is at version 2.9-4 and uses **ttf-font-icons**.

Packages of the **Stable Update 2015-11-01** have been used to create the install media. Both init systems **Systemd** and **OpenRC**, **32bit** and **64bit** are available with
graphical installer **Calamares** and our **CLI-installer** included.
