title: Manjaro Update 2016-02-29 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **tenth update** of Manjaro 15.12 (Capella)!

With this we update blender, calibre, cinelerra, espeak and guvcview and have patched kernel 4.1.18 to properly fix last week's cryptsetup issue. Most Bspwm- and Deepin-packages receive an update aswell.

Archlinux upstream fixes are now of: Sun Feb 28 08:36:16 CET 2016.

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Kind regards,
Philip MÃ¼ller and the Manjaro Development Team
