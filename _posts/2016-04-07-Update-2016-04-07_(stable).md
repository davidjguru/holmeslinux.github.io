title: Manjaro Update 2016-04-07 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **fifteenth update of Manjaro 15.12** (Capella)!

With this we updated some of our kernels, jdk7, haskell, network manager, wine, nvidia driver to 361.42, fixed some issues in LibreOffice and renewed some OpenRC packages. MHWD got also some few updates.

Archlinux upstream fixes are now from: Tue Apr 5 06:11:40 CEST 2016.

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
The Manjaro Development Team
