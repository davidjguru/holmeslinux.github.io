The Manjaro Community is proud to announce the release of our **Fluxbox edition 15.10**  
Graphically this desktop has been completely redesigned with the new icon-, gtk- and wallpaper-themes **Numix-Reborn** by UgoYak who has also contributed corresponding **Plymouth-bootscreen** and **Oblogout-button theming**.  
  
**Plank** aswell as the advanced **Dmenu-manjaro** are your new application launchers and with **fbmenugen** the right-click-menu can now be regenerated automatically when you add new software.  
  
**Manjaro-Welcome**, the image viewer **Geeqie** and **Simple-Scan** have been added,  
both graphical installers **Thus** and **Calamares** are included aswell as the well-proven **CLI-installer**.  
  
You have the choice between init systems **Systemd** and **OpenRC**,  
both architectures **32** and **64bit** are available.  
  
Install media have been created including the latest Manjaro- and Arch Linux-updates on the **stable branch**.  
  
kind regards  
Bernhard Landauer, Maintainer Manjaro-Fluxbox
