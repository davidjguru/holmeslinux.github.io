Hi community,

wonderful news in regard of architecture expanding within Manjaro Linux. It all started with a [simple post](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-dev/Week-of-Mon-20151228/000848.html) on our developers mailing list. Somebody wants to do Manjaro for ARM ...

Just after one month of development our first [alpha release](http://manjaro-arm.org/blog.php?p=31) is now ready. So what is this all about?

Manjaro Arm is a project aimed to bring you the simplicity and customability that is Manjaro to ARM devices. These devices are growing in numbers and can be used for any number of applications. Most famous is the Raspberry Pi series and BeagleBoard series. 

There are hundreds of these devices, sometimes called SBC (single board computers) or embedded devices, floating around and while we dont support all of them, we try our best to build and maintain as many as we can.

If you would like to have your device(s) supported and would like to help out, let us know. We would love to be able to grow to as many devices as we possibly can. Also we are still searching for some [contributors](http://manjaro-arm.org/blog.php?p=30).

kind regards, Dodge JCR and the Manjaro-ARM development team
