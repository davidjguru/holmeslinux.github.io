title: Manjaro Update 2016-04-15 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our sixteenth update of Manjaro 15.12 (Capella)!

With this we updated some of our kernels, plasma5, cinnamon, python2, alsa and fresh opensource drivers for AMD graphic cards. We removed the 4.3 kernel series. We recommend to update your system to 4.4 LTS series right now.

Also Guillaume was working for some time on a new design for pamac. Even if there is still some work to do, he wants some feedback on the work he had done so far. That for he proposed a preview version.

It has a new design:

* double click on a package name to view details.
* in dependencies view, click on a dependency to view its details
* you can continue browsing packages while a transaction is running

So tell us what you think about it on [github](https://github.com/manjaro/pamac/issues/113)!

Archlinux upstream fixes are now from: Sat Apr 9 12:17:53 CEST 2016.

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
The Manjaro Development Team
