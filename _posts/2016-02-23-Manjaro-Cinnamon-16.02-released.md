The Manjaro community is proud to announce a new stable release of the **Cinnamon Edition**.

In addition to the **full edition** with office suite, graphics software and mailclient included, **Manjaro Cinnamon 16.02** is also available as a **minimal-ISO** of 1GB download size, with users in mind who prefer to setup their own choice of software.

Recent development at Manjaro Linux is taking the **rolling release** model a step further by now delivering all **desktop settings** via **packages**. Like that users will have the option to update to the latest stage of development, even in regards of styling and desktop configuration, at any time if they wish - a feature that has often been requested.

This edition comes with the new gtk-themes **Vertex Maia** and **Vertex Maia Square**, developed by the community to perfectly match the Maia icon theme.  

**highlights**:  

* Kernel Linux 4.1
* Cinnamon 2.8.6

Please verify the downloaded ISO files with the provided **checksum** before installation, or check the encrypted **gpg signature**:
