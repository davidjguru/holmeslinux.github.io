title: Manjaro Update 2015-11-30 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **eight update** for Manjaro 15.09 (Bellatrix)!

Archlinux decided to go with Xorg-Server 1.18.0 even with the fact that Catalyst doesn't support that server yet. Therefor we used once more our overlay feature which blocks that series from updating. However I already updated some drivers against the 1.17 series of the Xorg-Server, including the latest Nvidia drivers.

Everybody who wants to play with bleeding edge can tryout Linux 4.4-rc2. Except ZFS all extramodules I was able to compile.

More changes in regard of Deepin and Cinnamon got introduced with this update. We are now using more upstream Archlinux packages for both desktop environments. Python and Haskell got again some updates and Thunderbird is now at 38.4.0. The first release candidate of Wine 1.8 completes this update.

Last but not least: for all gamefreaks out there. 0ad is now at Alpha build 19. Happy gaming.
Archlinux upstream fixes are now from: Sat Nov 28 11:08:00 CET 2015.

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip MÃ¼ller and the Manjaro Development Team
