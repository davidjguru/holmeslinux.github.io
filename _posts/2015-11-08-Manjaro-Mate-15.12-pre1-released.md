Here I present the first Manjaro Mate 15.12 preview. On a part, I want to slow it down and follow more Manjaro development. This ISO contains the Mate-Desktop 1.12. This desktop has a lot of improvements under the skin.

Hightlights:

* Fixes and improvements for GTK3 support across the entire MATE Desktop including GTK 3.18 support.
* Touchpad support is significantly improved and now features multi touch and natural scrolling.
* Multi monitor support has been improved so the display settings use output names and the revised UI lets you set the primary monitor.
* The power applet now displays model and vendor information so you can distinguish between multiple battery powered devices.
* Improved session management which now includes screensaver inhibition while playing media.
* MATE now listens to the org.gnome.SessionManager namespace.
* Extended systemd support.
* Long standing bugs and many little usability paper-cuts were fixed.
* For example, panel applets are no longer reordered when changing screen resolutions.
* Translations updated and a number of components now retrieve strings directly from gschema (requires intltool 0.50.1).
* Dropped support for win32 and osx.

More info can been found in the [release announcement of MATE](http://mate-desktop.org/blog/2015-11-05-mate-1-12-released/).

Package based highlights

* Libreoffice-still
* Mate & Mate-extra (GTK2 version)
* Firefox & Thunderbird
* Vertex & Vertex-icons
         
I also tried to make the ISO a bit lighter, but still it comes with 1.4gb and 1.5gb in size. Using abiword & gnumeric would bring it down a bit, but people don't want these alternatives, so it is LibreOffice.

**Unstable** branch was used to create these install medias. Please give us feedback and report any issues with this release.

kind regards
