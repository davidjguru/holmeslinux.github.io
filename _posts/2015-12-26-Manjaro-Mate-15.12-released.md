Manjaro Mate-Desktop 1.12 released! After a month of testing, stable release comes finaly true!

What had changed in Mate-Desktop?

* Fixes and improvements for GTK3 support across the entire MATE Desktop including GTK 3.18 support.
* Touchpad support is significantly improved and now features multitouch and natural scrolling.
* Multi monitor support has been improved so the display settings use output names and the revised UI lets you set the primary monitor.
* The power applet now displays model and vendor information so you can distinguish between multiple battery powered devices.
* Improved session management which now includes screensaver inhibition while playing media.
* MATE now listens to the org.gnome.SessionManager namespace.
* Extended systemd support.
* Long standing bugs and many little usability paper-cuts were fixed.
* For example, panel applets are no longer reordered when changing screen resolutions.
* Translations updated and a number of components now retrieve strings directly from gschema (requires intltool 0.50.1).

Further a month of developing manjaro worked hard on calamares and there manjaro-tools to have your enjoyment on a fresh & stable iso. We used the GTK2 version for this iso to rely on a stable mate desktop. Further the iso is improved with a own manjaro-mate-desktop-settings file to make the desktop stable in work out from start.
