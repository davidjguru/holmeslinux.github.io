title: Fluxbox Menu update
---
 
Driven by the huge resonance to our Community Edition **Manjaro-Fluxbox 15.10** we have been working hard to improve, tweak and polish this release during the last days.

The right-click menu has been very much improved and the **Regenerate menu function** now writes entries for added software seamlessly into the pre-configured list.
**Dmenu-manjaro** as a convenient and fast alternative can be accessed with the **Super+d** keyboard-shortcut.

**Lxrandr** has been added for screen-configuration and **multihead support**.

The updated install media are available for [Download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/manjaro-fluxbox/files/manjaro-fluxbox-15.10/) immediately.

On existing Manjaro-Fluxbox systems the new menu can easily be installed with 'sudo pacman -S fbmenu-manjaro'.

kind regards
