title: Manjaro Update 2015-11-01 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **fifth update** for Manjaro 15.09 (Bellatrix)!

Great news for all AMD users. We managed to get Catalyst working for linux42+! With this we updated most of our kernels, xorg-server, mate, added more deepin packages, updated lumina-desktop plus fixed cogl for good.
 
**Linux310** got updated to **3.10.92**, **linux313** to **3.13.11.29**, **linux314** to **3.14.56**, **linux316** to **3.16.7.19**, **linux318** to **3.18.23**, **linux319** to **3.19.8.9**, **linux41** to **4.1.12**, **linux42** to **4.2.5**, **lumina-desktop** to **0.8.7** and **Xorg-Server** to **1.17.4**.

After a long discussion and evaluation we decided to ship nvidia 352.55 due known display resolution issues in newer driver branches. When Nvidia fixes these problems we may update again to a newer branch.

Also we ship the usual Archlinux upstream fixes (Sun Nov 1 08:02:11 CET 2015).

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip MÃ¼ller and the Manjaro Development Team
