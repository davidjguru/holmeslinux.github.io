We are happy to announce the stable release of Manjaro 15.12 (Capella)!

<iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KNSfwgGbrTA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

After almost three months of development we can present to you now Capella, our latest instance of Manjaro Linux. This release comes with XFCE 4.12, KDE Plasma 5.5, 4.1.0 LTS kernel and all the usual Manjaro and upstream updates. We worked mostly on our tools and the graphical installers.

Noteable changes in our tools:

* kcm module of Manjaro-Settings got reworked
* several enhancements to Pamac and Octopi
* optimizations and fixes to Manjaro-Tools
* a lvm issue was fixed within Thus

Package-wise we have following changes:

KDE Apps got updated to 15.12, Virtualbox is now at 5.0.12, mesa is at 11.0.8, wine at 1.8 and the kernel at 4.4-rc6. Bumblebee is now also fixed for OpenRC and small fixes went into our samba-share thunar plugin.

To round-up this update, you find here some additional packages. Some linux3xx kernels got updated, last-minute fixes for Plasma 5, haskell updates, renewed Deepin desktop 2015 and fixes to firefox complete Manjaro 15.12.

Archlinux upstream fixes are now from: Tue Dec 22 12:25:53 CET 2015.

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our stable branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages).

Kind regards,
Philip MÃ¼ller and the Manjaro Development Team
