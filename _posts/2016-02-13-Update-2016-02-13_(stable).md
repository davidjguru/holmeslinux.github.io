title: Manjaro Update 2016-02-13 (stable)
---

I'm happy to announce our **eighth update** of Manjaro 15.12 (Capella)!

With this we updated eric, flightgear, firefox, haskell, jdk8, calamares, linux42 and the free intel driver.

Archlinux upstream fixes are now from: Thu Feb 11 07:39:33 CET 2016.

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip MÃ¼ller and the Manjaro Development Team
