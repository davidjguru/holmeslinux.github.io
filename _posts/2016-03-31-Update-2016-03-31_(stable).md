title: Manjaro Update 2016-03-31 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **fourteenth update of Manjaro 15.12** (Capella)!

Many kernels updated, Budgie, Calamares 2.2 and a bluez bugfix.
Plasma 5.6.1 and Qt 5.6, Octopi 0.8.1, a fix for Menda gtk3 theme.

Archlinux upstream fixes are now from: Wed Mar 30 20:28:59 CEST 2016.

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
The Manjaro Development Team
