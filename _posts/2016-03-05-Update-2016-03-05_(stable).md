title: Manjaro Update 2016-03-05 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **eleventh update** of Manjaro 15.12 (Capella)!

With this we updated plasma to 5.5.5, pamac to 3.2, php to 7.0.4, haskell, python and renewed some of our kernels (310, 314, 44). We also have now a new manjaro-cli-installer package. 

Archlinux upstream fixes are now from: Sat Mar 5 10:13:12 CET 2016.

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip MÃ¼ller and the Manjaro Development Team
