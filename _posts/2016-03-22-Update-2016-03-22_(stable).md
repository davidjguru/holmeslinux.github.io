title: Manjaro Update 2016-03-22 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **thirteenth update** of Manjaro 15.12 (Capella)!

Includes Libreoffice (fresh) update, bugfix release of KDE Applications 15.12.3, Cinnamon, Pamac bugfixes, Opera 36, Linux 4.5 and Virtualbox modules updates for all kernels.
OpenRC had some updates as well.

Upstream updates from Arch Linux are now from: Sun Mar 20 23:23:34 CET 2016.

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
The Manjaro Development Team
