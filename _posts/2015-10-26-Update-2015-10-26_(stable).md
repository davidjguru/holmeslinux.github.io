title: Manjaro Update 2015-10-26 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **fourth update** for Manjaro 15.09 (Bellatrix)!

With this we updated most of our kernels, python virtualbox and haskell. **Linux310** got updated to **3.10.91**, **linux313** to **3.13.11.28**, **linux314** to **3.14.55**, **linux319** to **3.19.8.8**, **linux41** to **4.1.11**, **linux42** to **4.2.4** and **linux43** to **4.3-rc7**. Also **budgie**, **pamac** and **octopi** we renewed with new point-releases.

As usual we ship the usual Archlinux upstream fixes (Mon Oct 26 08:32:52 CET).

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip MÃ¼ller and the Manjaro Development Team
