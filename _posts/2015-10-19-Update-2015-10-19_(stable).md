title: Manjaro Update 2015-10-19 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **third update** for Manjaro 15.09 (Bellatrix)!

This is one of the biggest update-pack for Manjaro 15.09 yet. Especially the OpenRC-Team worked hard to get this smooth as possible.

With this we updated **FlashPlugin** to **11.2.202.540**, **Gnome** to **3.18.1**, **KDE Apps** to **15.08.2**, **KDE Frameworks** to **5.15**, **Octopi** to **0.7.6**, **Pamac** to **2.4.2-3**, **Calamares** to **1.1.4.2-4**, **Firefox** to **41.0.2**, **Maia** theme to **0.5.3**, **Virtualbox** to **5.0.6**, **Calligra** to **2.9.8**, **linux43** to **4.3-rc5**, **wine** to **1.7.53**, **systemd **to **227** and added some **python 3.5 fixes** for several packages, plus **renewed most of our OpenRC stack** including needed fixes.

Also we ship the usual Archlinux upstream fixes(Mon Oct 19 09:30:30 CEST 2015)

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our stable branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
Philip MÃ¼ller and the Manjaro Development Team
