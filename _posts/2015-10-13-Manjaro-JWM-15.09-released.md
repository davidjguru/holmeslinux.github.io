The Manjaro Community is proud to announce the release of our **JWM Edition 15.09-1 (Bellatrix)**.

JWM (Joe’s Window Manager) is a lightweight stacking window manager for the X Window System written by Joe Wingbermuehle. JWM is **written in C** and uses only Xlib at a minimum. Configuration is by editing an XML file - no graphical configuration is supplied.
