title: Rebase of Menda theme - Artists needed
---

Hello community,

seems it is time to rebase our Menda theme once more. Gtk 3.18 introduced some defects into the current one. So what would be a nice theme fitting Manjaro Linux? The new Arc theme came in mind. However it is Cyan based, which doesn't fit our more green based style we have now.

It would be great if some of you would join our artwork team and help us to recolour it.

Kind regards,
Philip MÃ¼ller and the Manjaro Development Team
