title: Manjaro Update 2016-03-11 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our **twelfth update** of Manjaro 15.12 (Capella)!

This update includes an important OpenSSL update (including many packages which depend on it), kernels updated, GTK2, cryptsetup as well as the latest version of Mozilla Firefox, Chromium and Wine.

Archlinux upstream fixes are now from: Thu Mar 10 05:23:01 CET 2016.

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
The Manjaro Development Team
