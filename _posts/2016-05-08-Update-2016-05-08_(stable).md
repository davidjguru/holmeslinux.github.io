title: Manjaro Update 2016-05-08 (stable)
---

We are happy to announce our eigthteenth update of Manjaro 15.12 (Capella)!

With this we updated most of our kernels, openrc stack, openssl, Calamares, Pamac, Lumina-Desktop, Cinnamon and Steam. We also have now an updated toolchain based on gcc6, libre-office 5.0.6 and regular rebuilds due pacman-hooks.

Archlinux upstream fixes are now from: Sun May 8 12:31:31 CEST 2016.

It is always good to check for updated packages, even we don't notify you about them. As usual people using our testing branch will help us to get snaps over to our branch almost smoothly. For notifications on daily bases please take a look at our [mailing list](https://lists.manjaro.org/pipermail/manjaro-packages/).

Please give us feedback and report any findings with this update.

Kind regards,
The Manjaro Development Team
